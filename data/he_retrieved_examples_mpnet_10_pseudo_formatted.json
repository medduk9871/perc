Add the digits in odd positions (starting from the rightmost digit) and subtract the sum of the digits in even positions.\n4. If the result is divisible by 11, the original number is also divisible by 11.\n\nHere is the code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_divisible_by_11(number):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    number_str = str(number)\n    \n    # Iterate through the digits of the number\n    sum_odd = 0\n    sum_even = 0\n    for i in range(len(number_str)):\n        digit = int(number_str[i])\n        \n        # Add the digits in odd positions and subtract the digits in even positions\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            sum_odd += digit\n        else:\n            sum_even += digit\n    \n    # Check if the result is divisible by 11\n    if (sum_odd - sum_even) % 11 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nYou can use this function to check if a number is divisible by 11.
